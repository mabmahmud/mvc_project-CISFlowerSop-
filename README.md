Overview
Welcome to the CIS2232 project.  It will require implementation of the basic outcomes of the course.  The project must work with the environment for the CIS development team.  The system code will adhere to CIS standards.  This includes naming and commenting conventions. The project should follow an object-oriented design with packages used to organize classes.  These are constraints put on the development based on the organizational standards.
Although most of the requirements are individual, teams must complete some together.  
•	The project manager (aka learning manager) will assign a color scheme to each team.
•	The developer will build the system according to Object-oriented design principles.   
•	The createDatabase.sql file will create the application database.  The learning manager must approve any changes to the database structure.  
•	The due dates for sprints are contained in the SAM calendar.

Create database script	To be provided in CIS2232_20202021_project repository.
	

Common Requirements:
•	All projects must have an about option.  In this page, the information about the developers must be provided.
•	Developer to use Bitbucket for project version control.  The developer must complete the readme in Bitbucket for the project.
Database Notes:
•	When deploying to Linux database table and field names are case sensitive!  Be sure to use database-naming standards and be case specific in your Java code.  Things may work localhost but not when deployed to the Linux web server.
•	The foreign key constraints are not part of this project. This is to simplify the class structure while using Spring Data JPA.
•	Most dates are stored as varchar(8) and yyyymmdd format.
Distribution of work
Teams of developers will complete the project.  Working together will be encouraged, but the assigned tasks are independent of one another.  Working as a team will allow a more real-life experience.  Each developer is responsible for only their assigned requirements.  See Appendix A for team assignments.
Name	Business Requirements
Team member 1	1,3,5,7
Team member 2	2,4,6,8
	

Project Requirements
Your team has been asked to build a flower shop sales system.  This would be used by a flower shop to administer sales.  This activity can grow to be quite complex, so the scope is to be limited in scope for this version.  
Business Requirements  

The core functionality of the system will be to allow the business to administer their business.  There are components which would be required to make this possible.
The cisadmin application can be used to administer the users.  This is not something that needs to be built into the new application.  
File I/O
Requirement 1 – Save Orders to File
Provide the ability to save order data to file using json format.  All the information from the Order table should be written to the file.  The filename should be c:\flowers\orders_yyyymmddhhmmss.json where the yyyymmddhhmmss is replaced with the date and time that the report was run.

Requirement 2 – Save Customer Information to File
Provide the ability to save customer data to file using json format.  All of the information from the Customer table should be written to the file.  The filename should be c:\flowers\customers_yyyymmddhhmmss.json where the yyyymmddhhmmss is replaced with the date and time that the report was run. 
Web Application
Requirement 3 – Order CRUD
Provide the ability to create, read, update and delete Order data.  When the user selects the customer, they should be able to pick from a drop down of customer names and the associated customer id will be stored in the database.  The user is to enter the number of each type of item that they want to order.  It would be good to be able to see the name of the item from the database ItemType reference table.
Requirement 4 – Customer CRUD
Provide the ability to create, read, update and delete data.  When the user is to provide the customer type, they should be able to choose from a drop-down list of values obtained from a reference table.
Web Application Reports
Requirement 5 – Monthly Order Summary
This report should allow the user to specify the date range for a report.  The report should then show all the orders and a summary of the total.
Requirement 6 – Show Customer Summary
The user should be able choose a customer.  The system should then give a summary of the orders for that customer along with a total of the orders.
Web Services
The web services should follow REST standards including the response codes when data is found, not found, inserted, not inserted, etc.
Requirement 7 – Order Service
These services should provide get/post services 
Get
…/api/OrderService/orders
…/api/OrderService/orders/1

Post (to insert an order)
